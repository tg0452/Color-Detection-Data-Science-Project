COLOR DETECTION USING PYTHON

INTRODUCTION

Color plays a important role in human daily life for recognition. Color plays
crucial role on how we perceive and analyze things around us. Based on
primary colors (Red, Green, Blue), a lot of color models were established to
quantitatively measure color. Quantitative color measurement is one of the key
component in color science, scene analysis, detection and tracking. RGB and
HSV color model are one of the simple color models that are widely used today
in detection and tracking. There are many important real-world applications in
which color detection can be applied, such as skin color detection, traffic light
detection, vehicle color recognition, image segmentation, biometric
identification, video surveillance, and etc.
